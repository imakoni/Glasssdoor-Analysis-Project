Dynamic arrays are used to identify growth opportunities for a placement agency and job seekers. The spill range feature was utilized to calculate the growth in salaries from 2019- 2020 by the sum of the Average salary range in column B divided by Year over Year % growth in column C.  In this case, one formula was able to provide the results that previously required individual calculations for each cell.
